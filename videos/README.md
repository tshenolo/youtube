# 🎥 YouTube Video Archive

This folder contains organized resources for each of my YouTube videos.  
For every video, you'll find:

- 🔗 Link to the video  
- 💻 Commands and scripts used  
- 📁 Downloadable files  
- 📝 Extended explanation (optional)

Each video is stored in its own folder with the naming convention: YYYY-MM-DD-title-format-like-this

Use this folder as your gateway to deeper learning after each video.  

Stay tuned — more folders and content added as new videos go live!
